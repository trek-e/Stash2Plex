## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-23 (new-milestone workflow)
Stopped at: Requirements defined (17 reqs, 4 categories). Research complete (STACK/FEATURES/ARCHITECTURE/PITFALLS/SUMMARY). Need to spawn roadmapper to create ROADMAP.md with phase structure continuing from Phase 23.
Resume file: None
Next step: Create roadmap (spawn gsd-roadmapper with starting phase 23, read REQUIREMENTS.md + research/SUMMARY.md + PROJECT.md)

**Resume instructions for next session:**
The /gsd:new-milestone workflow was interrupted after Step 9 (requirements). Step 10 (roadmap creation) is next:
- Spawn gsd-roadmapper agent
- Starting phase number: 23 (v1.5 ended at 22)
- Files: .planning/PROJECT.md, .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md, .planning/research/SUMMARY.md, .planning/config.json, .planning/MILESTONES.md
- After roadmap: get user approval, commit, present next steps
