# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-24)

**Core value:** Reliable sync — when metadata changes in Stash, it eventually reaches Plex
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Persistent Queue Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Persistent Queue Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (Phase 1 complete)
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-24 — Completed 01-03-PLAN.md

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 20% (3/15 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.15 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Persistent Queue Foundation | 3 | 9 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5min), 01-02 (1min), 01-03 (3min)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**From 01-03 (Hook Handler & Background Worker):**
- Hook handler completes in <100ms by filtering and enqueueing only
- Worker runs in daemon thread with 10-second timeout on get_pending
- Worker tracks retry counts per pqid for max_retries enforcement
- Unknown errors treated as transient (nack for retry)
- Process job stubbed for Phase 3 Plex API implementation
- Plugin initializes on first stdin input, not on import

**From 01-02 (Dead Letter Queue):**
- Separate DLQ database (dlq.db) from main queue for long retention
- Store full job_data as pickled BLOB for complete error context
- 30-day default retention period for DLQ cleanup

**From 01-01 (Queue Infrastructure):**
- Used persist-queue SQLiteAckQueue for built-in crash recovery (vs custom SQLite queue)
- Queue stored in $STASH_PLUGIN_DATA or ~/.stash/plugins/PlexSync/data
- Dict-compatible SyncJob structure for safe pickle serialization
- Stateless operations pattern - functions receive queue instance

**Prior decisions:**
- Fork locally for development (Pending) — Need to test changes against real Stash/Plex setup

### Pending Todos

### Blockers/Concerns
