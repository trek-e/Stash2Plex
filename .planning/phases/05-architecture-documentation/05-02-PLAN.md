# Plan 05-02: Contributing Guide

## Objective

Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` - a brief guide for contributors covering dev setup, PR workflow, and testing expectations. Keeps it concise per user decision (no full walkthrough, just essentials).

**Purpose:** Lower barrier for new contributors by documenting the basics of contributing to PlexSync.

**Output:** Single markdown file in project root with dev setup, PR guidelines, and testing info.

## Deliverables

- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` (60-100 lines)

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Contributing Guide

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create CONTRIBUTING.md with contributor guidelines</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` in project root with the following sections:

**1. Welcome/Introduction (5-10 lines)**
- Brief welcome message
- Link to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for codebase understanding
- Mention this is a Stash plugin for Plex metadata sync

**2. Development Setup (15-20 lines)**
Brief setup instructions (per CONTEXT.md decision - reference files, don't walkthrough):
- Clone repo
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
- Note: No code style tools (black/ruff) are configured - follow existing code patterns
- Link to Stash plugin development docs for testing in Stash environment

**3. Running Tests (15-20 lines)**
- `pytest` runs all tests
- `pytest --cov` for coverage report
- `pytest tests/test_specific.py` for single file
- `pytest -m "not slow"` to skip slow tests
- Coverage threshold: 80% (configured in pytest.ini)
- Tests encouraged but not strictly required for small changes

**4. Pull Request Process (20-25 lines)**
Standard GitHub flow:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make changes
4. Run tests (`pytest`)
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. Push to your fork
7. Open PR against main branch

PR guidelines:
- Keep changes focused (one feature/fix per PR)
- Include test coverage for new functionality when practical
- Update docs if adding user-facing features
- Describe what and why in PR description

**5. Code Style (10 lines)**
- No automated formatters configured
- Follow existing code patterns
- Type hints encouraged (project uses Pydantic)
- Docstrings for public functions

**6. Getting Help (5 lines)**
- Open an issue for questions
- Check existing issues before opening new ones
- Reference docs/troubleshoot.md for common issues

**Style guidelines:**
- Keep it brief - this is a solo developer project, not enterprise
- Assume contributor knows Git/GitHub basics
- Reference existing files rather than duplicating content
- ~80 lines total target
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at CONTRIBUTING.md (project root, not docs/)
- Contains dev setup section with requirements-dev.txt reference
- Contains PR process section
- Contains testing section with pytest commands
- Word count 400-800 words
  </verify>
  <done>
CONTRIBUTING.md exists with:
- Dev setup instructions (brief, references requirements files)
- PR workflow (standard GitHub flow)
- Testing expectations (pytest, 80% coverage target)
- Code style guidance (follow existing patterns)
- Links to ARCHITECTURE.md and troubleshoot.md
  </done>
</task>

### Task 2: Verify Document Completeness

<task type="auto">
  <name>Validate contributing guide covers all required topics</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
Verify the created document covers all required topics:

1. Check for required sections:
   - Development setup (with requirements-dev.txt mention)
   - Running tests (with pytest commands)
   - Pull request process (with fork/branch/PR steps)

2. Check for required references:
   - Link to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Reference to requirements-dev.txt
   - pytest commands

3. Verify line count is in range (60-100 lines)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `wc -l CONTRIBUTING.md` (should be 60-120)
Run: `grep -c "^##" CONTRIBUTING.md` (should be 4-7 sections)
Run: `grep -q "requirements-dev" CONTRIBUTING.md && echo "PASS"`
Run: `grep -q "pytest" CONTRIBUTING.md && echo "PASS"`
Run: `grep -q "ARCHITECTURE" CONTRIBUTING.md && echo "PASS"`
  </verify>
  <done>
Document passes all validation checks:
- Line count within range
- All required sections present
- Required references included
  </done>
</task>

## must_haves

- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md exists in project root (60-100 lines)
- [ ] Dev setup section references requirements-dev.txt
- [ ] Testing section includes pytest commands and 80% coverage note
- [ ] PR process section covers fork, branch, PR workflow
- [ ] Links to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for codebase understanding
- [ ] Notes that no code formatters are configured

## Dependencies

None - this plan can run independently (parallel with 05-01).

Note: Plan references docs/ARCHITECTURE.md which is created in 05-01, but the link can be written before the file exists. Both plans are Wave 1 (parallel).

## Verification

```bash
# File exists and has content
test -f CONTRIBUTING.md && echo "PASS: File exists"

# Check line count (60-100 target)
lines=$(wc -l < CONTRIBUTING.md)
[ "$lines" -ge 60 ] && [ "$lines" -le 120 ] && echo "PASS: Line count $lines"

# Check required content
grep -q "requirements-dev" CONTRIBUTING.md && echo "PASS: Dev requirements referenced"
grep -q "pytest" CONTRIBUTING.md && echo "PASS: pytest mentioned"
grep -q "fork" CONTRIBUTING.md && echo "PASS: Fork mentioned"
grep -q "ARCHITECTURE" CONTRIBUTING.md && echo "PASS: Architecture link"
```

## Success Criteria

- New contributor can:
  - Set up dev environment following the instructions
  - Understand how to run tests
  - Know the PR submission process
- Document is concise (~80 lines, not enterprise-level process)
- No contradictions with existing docs (install.md, troubleshoot.md)
