<objective>
Create README.md with project overview, quick start guide, and links to detailed documentation.

Purpose: First touchpoint for new users - must convey value and get them started fast
Output: README.md at project root

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md with the following structure:

1. **Title and Badges**
   - "# PlexSync"
   - Brief tagline: "Sync metadata from Stash to Plex with queue-based reliability"

2. **Overview Section** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What PlexSync does: syncs scene metadata (title, studio, performers, tags) from Stash to Plex
   - Key features: persistent queue, automatic retry, circuit breaker, crash recovery
   - When to use: users who have media organized in Stash and want Plex to reflect that metadata

3. **Quick Start Section** (numbered steps, under 5 minutes)
   - Prerequisites: Stash running, Plex running, PythonDepManager plugin installed in Stash
   - Step 1: Clone/download PlexSync to Stash plugins folder
   - Step 2: Reload plugins in Stash
   - Step 3: Configure required settings (plex_url, plex_token, plex_library)
   - Step 4: Test by updating a scene in Stash and checking Plex

   Include: How to get Plex token (link to Plex support article or brief instructions)

4. **How It Works** (brief, 3-4 bullets)
   - Hook triggers on scene update in Stash
   - Job queued to SQLite-backed persistent queue
   - Background worker syncs to Plex with retry on failure
   - Permanent failures go to dead letter queue

5. **Documentation Links**
   - [Installation Guide](docs/install.md) - Full setup instructions
   - [Configuration Reference](docs/config.md) - All settings explained
   - [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshoot.md) - Common issues and solutions

6. **Requirements** (brief list)
   - Stash (any recent version)
   - Plex Media Server
   - PythonDepManager Stash plugin
   - Python dependencies (auto-installed)

7. **License**
   - GPL-3.0 (matches LICENSE file)

Keep it concise. No screenshots (per user decision). Link to docs/ for details.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - File exists: `test -f README.md && echo "EXISTS"`
    - Has Quick Start: `grep -q "## Quick Start" README.md && echo "HAS_QUICKSTART"`
    - Has doc links: `grep -q "docs/install.md" README.md && echo "HAS_INSTALL_LINK"`
    - Line count reasonable: `wc -l README.md` (should be 80-150 lines)
  </verify>
  <done>
README.md exists at project root with:
- Clear overview explaining PlexSync's purpose
- Quick start section completable in under 5 minutes
- Links to all three docs (install.md, config.md, troubleshoot.md)
- How it works section explaining queue-based approach
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create docs/ directory structure</name>
  <files>docs/.gitkeep</files>
  <action>
Create the docs/ directory with a placeholder file to ensure it's tracked by git.

```bash
mkdir -p docs
touch docs/.gitkeep
```

This prepares the directory structure for subsequent plans (install.md, config.md, troubleshoot.md).

Note: Per user decision, docs/ does NOT need its own README.md index file since there are only 3 files and README.md links directly to them.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Directory exists: `test -d docs && echo "EXISTS"`
    - Directory tracked: `git status docs/ --short`
  </verify>
  <done>
docs/ directory exists and is ready for documentation files
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

All checks pass:
- `test -f README.md` returns success
- `grep -q "## Quick Start" README.md` returns success
- `grep -q "docs/install.md" README.md` returns success
- `grep -q "docs/config.md" README.md` returns success
- `grep -q "docs/troubleshoot.md" README.md` returns success
- `test -d docs` returns success
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README.md conveys PlexSync's purpose within first 30 seconds of reading
- Quick start section has clear numbered steps
- All three documentation links present and correct
- docs/ directory ready for subsequent plans
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-user-documentation/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
