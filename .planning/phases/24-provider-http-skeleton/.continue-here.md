<current_state>
Phase 24 complete. Session was spent on production bug-fixing (v1.5.14 → v1.5.15 → v1.5.16) for infinite requeue loop and packaging issues. No v2.0 phase work done this session.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- v1.5.14: Fix get_queued_scene_ids() to include completed items in dedup (24h window)
- v1.5.15: Fix requeue loop surviving 24h+ sessions — added persistent sync_timestamps guard in reconciliation/engine.py _enqueue_gaps(), extended dedup window to 7 days
- v1.5.16: Fix plugin load errors — excluded .github/ directory from zip (Stash parses all .yml as plugin config)
- All three versions released to GitHub with proper zip, sha256, tags
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 25: Match Endpoint — not started, no CONTEXT.md exists yet
- Need to discuss or plan Phase 25 before execution
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Persistent sync_timestamps guard is the permanent fix for requeue loop — doesn't depend on queue row age
- completed_window extended to 7 days as defense-in-depth (was 24h)
- .github/ must NEVER be included in plugin zip — Stash treats all .yml as plugin config
- Release workflow: always commit zip to repo (Stash fetches from raw.githubusercontent.com, not release assets)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. Clean transition to Phase 25.

<context>
Three rapid-fire bug fix releases this session. The infinite requeue loop had two layers: (1) dedup only checking pending/in-progress status, fixed in v1.5.14; (2) dedup window anchored to enqueue time which ages out after 24h, fixed in v1.5.15 with sync_timestamps guard. v1.5.16 was a packaging fix — .github/ YAML files in zip caused Stash unmarshal errors. User is running v1.5.16 now. Ready to move back to v2.0 provider work.
