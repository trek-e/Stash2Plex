# Requirements: PlexSync v1.2

**Defined:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** COMPLETE (2026-02-04)
**Core Value:** Reliable sync — when metadata changes in Stash, it eventually reaches Plex

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for Queue UI Improvements milestone.

### Queue Management

- [x] **QUEUE-01**: User can view current queue status from Stash UI
- [x] **QUEUE-02**: User can clear/delete all queue items from Stash UI
- [x] **QUEUE-03**: User can purge dead letter queue entries from Stash UI
- [x] **QUEUE-04**: User sees confirmation dialog before destructive queue operations
- [x] **QUEUE-05**: User receives status feedback after queue operations complete

### Queue Processing

- [x] **PROC-01**: User can manually trigger queue processing from Stash UI
- [x] **PROC-02**: User can resume/continue processing for large backlogs
- [x] **PROC-03**: User sees progress feedback during manual processing
- [x] **PROC-04**: System handles long queues that stall due to Stash plugin timeout
- [x] **PROC-05**: Worker continues processing until queue is empty (not limited to 30s)
- [x] **PROC-06**: System supports batch processing mode for large queues

### Dynamic Timeout

- [x] **TIME-01**: System tracks average time to process each queue item
- [x] **TIME-02**: System calculates required timeout based on items × avg_time
- [x] **TIME-03**: System requests appropriate timeout from Stash plugin system (N/A - Stash doesn't expose API)
- [x] **TIME-04**: System handles cases where calculated timeout exceeds Stash limits
- [x] **TIME-05**: System provides fallback behavior when timeout cannot be extended
