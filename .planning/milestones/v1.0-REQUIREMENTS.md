milestone: v1.0
archived: 2026-02-03
status: complete
coverage: 13/13 (100%)
---

**Defined:** 2025-01-24
**Core Value:** Reliable sync — when metadata changes in Stash, it eventually reaches Plex

## v1 Requirements (All Complete)

### Retry & Reliability

- [x] **RTRY-01**: Failed Plex API calls retry with exponential backoff and jitter
- [x] **RTRY-02**: Transient errors (network, 5xx, timeout) trigger retry; permanent errors (4xx except 429) do not
- [x] **RTRY-03**: Permanently failed operations go to dead letter queue for manual review
- [x] **RTRY-04**: All Plex API calls have explicit connect and read timeouts

### Queue & Persistence

- [x] **QUEUE-01**: Sync jobs persist to SQLite-backed queue (survives process restart)
- [x] **QUEUE-02**: Hook handler captures events quickly (<100ms) and enqueues for background processing
- [x] **QUEUE-03**: Background worker processes queue with retry orchestration

### Input Validation

- [x] **VALID-01**: Metadata validated against schema before sending to Plex
- [x] **VALID-02**: Special characters sanitized to prevent API errors
- [x] **VALID-03**: Plugin configuration validated against schema on load

### Matching & Late Updates

- [x] **MATCH-01**: Improved matching logic reduces false negatives when finding Plex items
- [x] **MATCH-02**: Late metadata updates in Stash trigger re-sync to Plex
- [x] **MATCH-03**: Matches scored with confidence; low-confidence matches logged for review
